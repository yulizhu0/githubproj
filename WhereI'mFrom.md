# Where I'm From
## My Humble Origins - The Big Apple
Aside from my joke from the homepage, I was born in **[Brooklyn, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn)** to Fu Zhuo, my dad, and Fali Gong, my mother! I only spent a few months there as a baby because my dad would end up getting a job at the **University of Central Missouri in Missouri** (*the worst betrayal I've ever experienced in my life*) and my mom and I soon followed suit. Let me just preface that **I had no choice in the decision** which was quite rude in my opinion. We would stay in **[Warrensburg, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrensburg,_Missouri)** until I turned five years old.

## What Happened Next?
Once I turned five, my dad ended up getting a job at the **Univerity of Missouri - Kansas City**. Following this change, we promptly moved to good ol' **[Lees Summmit, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee%27s_Summit,_Missouri)** where I've spent most of my life now. Life in Lees Summit wasn't super exciting. But, what compensated were my Summer Breaks because that's when I would go to **[Wuhan, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan)** and visit my dad's side of the family!
