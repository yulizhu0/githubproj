# Where I'm From
## My Humble Origins - The Big Apple
Aside from my joke from the homepage, I was born in **[Brooklyn, New York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brooklyn)** to Fu Zhuo, my dad, and Fali Gong, my mother! I only spent a few months there as a baby because my dad would end up getting a job at the **University of Central Missouri in Missouri** (*the worst betrayal I've ever experienced in my life*) and my mom and I soon followed suit. Let me just preface that **I had no choice in the decision** which was quite rude in my opinion. We would stay in **[Warrensburg, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warrensburg,_Missouri)** until I turned five years old.

### What Happened Next?
Once I turned five, my dad ended up getting a job at the **Univerity of Missouri - Kansas City**. Following this change, we promptly moved to good ol' **[Lees Summmit, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee%27s_Summit,_Missouri)** where I've spent most of my life now. Life in Lees Summit wasn't super exciting. But, what compensated for the lack of entertainment were my Summer Breaks because that's when I would go to **[Wuhan, China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wuhan)** and visit my dad's side of the family! I would usually spend a month there with my grandparents and hit the town to try local cuisine, do some shopping, and go sightseeing.

### Where I Am Now
Nowadays, you can find me attending the **University of Missouri - Columbia** in **[Columbia, Missouri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia,_Missouri)**. While I don't really go to China anymore due to COVID-19 restrictions and increased ticket prices, I now usually just go back to see family in **Brooklyn** for the Summer. I jump between Brooklyn and the Bronx and it's been super nice getting to get used to day-to-day life there. It really puts into perspective how boring and limited Missouri is in comparison (_e.g. lack of accessible food options, public transportation, activities, free events, etc._). In addition to those factors, the diversity is also makes a **huge** difference. **My favorite place in New York is Flushing, Queens**. Thet have a Chinatown, which comes off as Manhatten Chinatown's _cooler younger sister_. It's super rereshing seeing a city populated by people who **look and sound like you**.
