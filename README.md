# githubproj
This is my Spring 2022 midterm project and first attempt at making a website on github!

## What's This About?
I'm just going to go over some basic introductory facts 'bout myself: **[where I come from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uterus), [who I am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asian_Woman)**, and **[what I do](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maternal_insult)**!  

### The Basics
* I'm a sophomore pursuing a **B.S. in Information Technology** and a **minor in Entrepreneurship and Innovation Management**
* I was raised in **Kansas City, Missouri**
* I work at the Student Center and Ellis help desk as an IT Consultant for the DoIT **here at Mizzou**
* I have a black cat named Hammy _(the "H" stands for heinous)_

## Why Am I Doing This?
It's because I have to.
