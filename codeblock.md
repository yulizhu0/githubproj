## Example of Code Block
### About Me: My first programming assignment for this class!
Here's the first formal thing I programmed for IT 1000:

    print("Hi, my name is Yuli!")
    x, y, z = "thrifting,", " making art,", " and gaming with my besties!"
    print("In my free time I enjoy", x + y + z)
    #Making about me-esque submissions makes me a little embarassed because I don't
    #LOVE talking about myself...hehe...
    print("""Doing this assingment made me realize the differences between HTML and Python because I've now gained some experience using both.
    It's cool to know that I can make my own opinions about different languages and programs because of this.
    I'm excited to learn more now that I've started!""")
    x = "I hope that by the end of the semester "
    y = "I will have developed "
    z = "a strong foundation of coding basics!"
    print(x + y + z)
    print("Love,")
    print("Yuli")
    
## Afterthoughts
I was **really proud of myself for doing this**! In hindsight, it was a very easy assignment, but I was still proud nonetheless as someone who went into this with _no prior knowledge or experience_. After this, I realized how fun programming is and noticed that I never really got frustrated with it! I just wanted to keep trying to fix my code until it worked.
