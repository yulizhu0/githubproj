# What I Do
## School & Extracurriculars
Like I've mentioned on the homepage, I'm a **Information Technology student**! I'm trying to get a Business Minor because I'm interested in tech management, but after attending an NYU IDM information session for grad school, **their IDM program sounds more appealing**. So, I might try to pursue UX/UI design instead. But, I'll have to learn that on the side because I don't think Mizzou offers that program. I _might_ be wrong though. I also am in the **Society of Women Engineers**, the **Mizzou Engineering Student Council**, and the **Asian American Association**! In addition to all of this,

## Hobbies
In my free time (which is nowadays very rare), I like to **draw**, **play piano**, and **slave away at League of Legends**. My gaming addiction has **really** become my most _reliable_ source of comfort...I also like working out with my boyfriend, riding my bike on nice days, and going on picnics with my friends!

## Future Aspirations
Like I mentioned earlier, I really want to learn how to do **UX/UI design**! I might look on _Coursera_ for some courses I can take during the summer. I'm going to be in New York **again** for the Summer, so I might decide to volunteer with some local-nonprofits.
