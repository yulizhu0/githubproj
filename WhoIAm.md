# Who I Am
## An Introduction
My name is Yolanda "**Yuli**" Zhuo and I'm a 20 year old college student! I'm also a Chinese woman and the child of first generation immigrants that grew up in the United States. I'm extremely proud of my cultural heritage and the experiences I've had growing up within a relatively traditional Chinese household too. That's also why I ended up decided to go by my Chinese name, **卓玉立** which is read as "**Zhuó YùLì**".

## Backstory
Growing up in Missouri was an odd experience. As a kid, I began to encounter covert and backhanded. Because I oftentimes didn't fit the stereotypes of "Chinese people", my peers made it a point to let me know that I didn't. I would recieve comments like "your eyes are bigger than other Chinese people", "you're surprisingly bad at math", or "you're not like the _others_...". I grew up thinking that it was bad to associate with Chinese culture or be identified as anything similar to other Asian individuals. It was so confusing to also see others enjoy my culture and appropiate it **especially when they weren't Chinese**. I didn't understand why everyone else could talk about dragons, kung fu, and play with chopsticks without anyone batting an eye while I had pinky fingers flipped off at me at recess by all of my classmates as they yelled "_Chinese middle finger!_".

>Why do people keep telling me that I'm different?

It peaked in middle school (middle school was probably purgatory for everyone including the teachers, lets be real) and I started experiencing more blatant discrimination. I remember in choir a kid named Ora turned to me and told me "you eat dog" straight to my face. I was flabbergasted as the more I kept denying it, he kept insisting that I did in front of the other choir kids. Even while he was doing this, nobody in our vicinity even tried to interject or interrupt him. **The complicity of others was more than enough to make me feel like a outsider**.

When I got to highschool, I met another Chinese girl, Ivy, who eventually became my dear friend and safe space. We bonded over our shared experiences, the cultural delicacies we both enjoyed, our broken Chinese, and our identities. I didn't realize how healing it was to find another person who I related to as much as I did to her. Our friendship helped me become much more confident in my culutral identity and overcome the shame I had harbored all of my childhood.

## Where I Am Now
Now, I'm proud to be who I am and represent the things I represent: _an Asian-American_. I'm proud to be Mizzou's Asian American Association's Advocacy chair where I get to talk to others about experiences like this and let other Asian-Americans know that **they're not alone in their struggles or celebrations**. I love who I've become.
