# Who I Am
## An Introduction
My name is Yolanda "**Yuli**" Zhuo and I'm a 20 year old college student! I'm also a Chinese woman and the child of first generation immigrants that grew up in the United States. I'm extremely proud of my cultural heritage and the experiences I've had growing up within a relatively traditional Chinese household too. That's also why I ended up decided to go by my Chinese name, **卓玉立** which is read as "**Zhuó YùLì**".

## Backstory
Growing up in Missouri was an odd experience. As a kid, I began to encounter covert and backhanded. Because I oftentimes didn't fit the stereotypes of "Chinese people", my peers made it a point to let me know that I didn't. I would recieve comments like "your eyes are bigger than other Chinese people", "you're surprisingly bad at math", or "you're not like the _others_...". I grew up thinking that it was bad to associate with Chinese culture or be identified as anything similar to other Asian individuals. It was so confusing to also see others enjoy my culture and appropiate it **especially when they weren't Chinese**. I didn't understand why everyone else could talk about dragons, kung fu, and play with chopsticks without anyone batting an eye while I had pinky fingers flipped off at me at recess by all of my classmates as they yelled "_Chinese middle finger!_".

>Why do people keep telling me that I'm different?

It peaked in middle school (middle school was probably purgatory for everyone including the teachers, lets be real) and I started experiencing more blatant discrimination. I remember in choir a kid named Ora turned to me and told me "you eat dog" straight to my face. I was flabbergasted as the more I kept denying it, he kept insisting that I did in front of the other choir kids. Even while he was doing this, nobody in our vicinity even tried to interject or interrupt him.
